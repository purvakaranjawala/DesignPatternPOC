**The Presenter Pattern or View Model Pattern, is a design pattern commonly used in web development, to separate the presentation logic from the business logic. It helps in keeping the views (templates) simple, clean, and focused on display concerns, while moving complex presentation logic to dedicated presenter classes**.

The main goals of the Presenter Design Pattern are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Isolate the presentation logic from the view and model.
2. **Reusability**: Allow reusing presentation logic across different views.
3. **Testability**: Facilitate easier unit testing of the presentation logic.

Here is implementation steps:-

  1. Create a Presenter Class:
    - Define a presenter class for each view or group of related views. 

  2. Initialization:
    - In the controller, create an instance of the presenter class and pass the necessary data (e.g., model objects) to it.

  3. Presentation Logic:
    - In the presenter class, implement methods that handle the presentation logic required for the specific view(s). This can include formatting data, handling conditional rendering, and preparing data for display.

  4. Keep Views Simple:
    - In the view (template), use the presenter methods to display the data.
      Avoid complex presentation logic directly in the view.

**Example:
**
Suppose we have a User model with attributes like `name`, `email`, and `created_at`. we want to display the user's name and formatted creation date on the user profile page.

1. Create a Presenter Class:

```ruby
# app/presenters/user_presenter.rb
class UserPresenter
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def display_name
    @user.name.capitalize
  end

  def formatted_created_at
    @user.created_at.strftime("%B %d, %Y")
  end
end
```

2. Controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    @presenter = UserPresenter.new(@user)
  end
end
```

3. View:

```html
<!-- app/views/users/show.html.erb -->
<h1><%= @presenter.display_name %></h1>
<p>Joined on <%= @presenter.formatted_created_at %></p>
```

By following this pattern, your Rails application becomes more organized, maintainable, and easier to test.
It also allows you to reuse the same presenter logic in multiple views if needed, making your codebase more efficient.
